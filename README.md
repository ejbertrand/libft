# libft
This is libft, a software development project part of the 42 School curriculum at SÃ£o Paulo.

I took some of the functions of the C Standard Library (cstdlib) and redefined them.
It contains three categories of functions:
- ASCII characters manipulation
- String manipulation
- Memory allocation, initialization and/or manipulation

The library contains a Makefile which produces a static library object (.a) compiled with GCC (GNU Compiler).
It can be safely downloaded and tested, as it has already been tested against the original function and the results are roughly the same.

Any comments or questions, feel free to contact.
